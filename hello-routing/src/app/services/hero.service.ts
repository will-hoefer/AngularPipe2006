* Dependency Injection
    -It is a part of a larger concept called IoC (Inversion of Control). We are

    -A singleton class is a class that can only be instantiated once. Every subsequent calling 
    of that class' constructor will return the same object.
    
    -Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern, and the Angular Injector is the entity that
    controls Classes with the @Injectable() and the @Component are handled by the Injector.
